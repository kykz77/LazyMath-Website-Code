# LazyMath-Website-Code
 Hello! Welcome to my website project!

 I run a website providing VCE students with free access to UDFs (User Defined Functions) which are essentially shortcuts to assist them in their tech 
 active exams. This repository contains all the code for the website, as well as for the JavaScript Chatbot I trained and developed using Tensorflow.js

 My website can be found at: lazymath.github.io
